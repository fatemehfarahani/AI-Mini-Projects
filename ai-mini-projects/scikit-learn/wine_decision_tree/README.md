# Wine Classification with Decision Tree

This mini project demonstrates how to classify the Wine dataset using a Decision Tree model from scikit-learn.

## Features

- Loads the Wine dataset from scikit-learn
- Splits the data into training and test sets
- Trains a Decision Tree classifier
- Evaluates the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Plots the confusion matrix and learning curve

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run

```bash
python wine_decision_tree.py
