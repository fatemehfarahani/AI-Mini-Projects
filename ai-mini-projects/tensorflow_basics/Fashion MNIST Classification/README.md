# Fashion MNIST Classification with CNN (Experimental Version)

This mini project demonstrates image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset using a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features

- Loads the Fashion MNIST dataset (images of clothing items)
- Normalizes and visualizes the images
- Builds and trains a basic CNN model
- Evaluates the model on test data
- Visualizes a sample test image and shows the true and predicted label

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tensorflow
- numpy
- matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
    ```
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python fashion_mnist_cnn.py
    ```

*(You will also see the image of the clothing item with its true label)*

## Notes

- **This is an experimental version.**
- You can improve the model's accuracy by adjusting the architecture, adding more layers, changing dropout rates, or tuning hyperparameters.
- The model uses a simple CNN structure and may not achieve the highest possible accuracy.
- Try experimenting with different optimizers, batch sizes, or data augmentation for better results.
